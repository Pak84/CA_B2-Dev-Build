# CA_B2-Dev-Build

drop these folders into the Cormorant Aeronology folder. It may want to replace some files from the LRBs but these are small cfg changes and texture updates which shouldn't have any effect on the current part balance.


DISCLAIMER

This is a Development Build of current progress on Block II parts.
This pack may include;

- Unfinished/untextured parts

- Broken parts

- Parts that may not be included upon release


Current State;

- Block II orbiter is functional for launch, orbit operations, and landing. This is a pretty bare bones version without a lot of the little quality of life stuff that I'll keep adding as I go.

- B2 Cockpit has blocked out IVA with no functionality yet

- Textures have some errors and unfinished areas

- Descriptions, tags, and localizations in progress

- New Block II parts like the airlock, advanced OMS pods, etc are in various stages of completion and will be added here as I go
