# CA_B2-Dev-Build

drop these folders into the Cormorant Aeronology folder. It may want to replace some files from the LRBs but these are small cfg changes and texture updates which shouldn't have any effect on the current part balance.

This is a Development Build of current progress on Block II parts.
This pack may include;

- Unfinished/untextured parts

- Broken parts

- Parts that may not be included upon release


Current State;

- Block II orbiter is mostly functional for launch, orbit, and landing

- B2 Cockpit has blocked out IVA with no functionality yet

- Textures have some errors and unfinished areas

- Descriptions, tags, and localizations in progress
